### The Portfolio website code in Next.js simulates a terminal interface, providing a seamless and interactive experience through command inputs, shell handling, and API interactions. Here's a brief breakdown of the key aspects of your implementation:

1. **Components Overview**:
    - `Input.tsx`: Manages the input field, capturing key events (like Ctrl+C, Ctrl+L, Enter, Tab, and arrow keys) and processing them accordingly (e.g., clearing history, tab completion, command execution).
    - `Ps1.tsx`: Displays the PS1 prompt, dynamically fetching and showing the public IP as the hostname.
    - `History.tsx`: Manages and displays the command history, showing past commands and their outputs.
    - `useHistory.tsx`: A hook that manages the history state, current command, and index for navigating through commands.

2. **Command Execution**:
    - Commands are handled in `shell.ts`, where commands like `clear` and others (from `bin`) are executed. Unrecognized commands return a helpful error message, like "command not found."
    - Commands that require API calls (like fetching weather or projects) are defined in `api_commands.ts` and utilize the axios library to interact with external APIs (e.g., GitHub, weather services).

3. **Tab Completion**:
    - In `tabCompletion.ts`, a function is implemented to handle tab completions, suggesting or auto-filling commands that match the input.

4. **API Interactions**:
    - Several commands rely on API calls (`getProjects`, `getWeather`, etc.), allowing dynamic fetching of data like GitHub repositories or weather updates.

5. **Styling and Font**:
    - You're using Tailwind CSS for the styling and custom fonts like `Hack` to enhance the terminal aesthetic.
    - Custom scrollbars are defined in your `global.css`, although you may want to remove them based on your previous preferences for no scrollbars.

6. **404 Handling**:
    - A simple 404 redirect is included to route users back to the homepage if they land on a non-existent page.
